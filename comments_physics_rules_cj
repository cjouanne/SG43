Comments on physics Rules 

1 Cross Section Errors
1.1. Monotonically increasing energy grid
(a) Discontinuity with > 2 equivalent energy points.
Comment : > 2 or 2 ? Example : H2 in JEFF-3.2 library at 14:25MeV . Energy
grid : 13:75; 14; 14:25; 14; 14:75MeV . Exception : Limits of resonance ranges, RRRURR,
RRR-Continuum and URR-Continuum.
1.2. Strictly positive energy values. OK
1.3. No negative cross section values.
Comment : Needs reconstruction in RRR and URR ranges. OK for continuum energy
range.
1.4. Kinematic threshold for threshold reactions The kinematic threshold is defined as
Th = 􀀀Q(A + An)=A
Where Q is the Q-value, A and An are the atomic mass numbers for the nucleus
and the incident particle (i.e., neutron) respectively.
Comment : First point in energy grid in MF3 should be in agreement with first
incoming energy in MF4, MF5, MF6. . . If not, in Monte Carlo calculation, you can
sample a reaction but you don’t find energy-angle distribution if first energy in MF6
is higher than kinematic threshold. Example : MT749, O16 in ENDF/B-VII.b4.
Threshold MF3 = 22.864 MeV. First energy in MF6/MT749 : 23.86 MeV for N14.
1.5. Do partial cross sections sum to total ? In the case of small cross sections, sometimes
it’s impossible to have total = sum of partial. Example for a 4 digits format :
p1=1.00003 (p1f = 1.0000 in format file), p2=1.00004 (p2f = 1.0000 in format file),
sum=p1+p2 = 2.00007 (2.0001 in format file), but p1f+p2f=2.0000
1.6. Check abnormally large (e.g., > 1E6) or abnormally small (e.g., 1E - 6) cross
section values. This is a rule that could be parameterized so that something really
bad is an error, whereby something just kind of big would be flagged as a warning.
It also has to be knowledgeable of charged particle reactions which have a Coulomb
barrier.
Comment : 10^-􀀀6 is a very high threshold for this kind of physics quantity. Example :
elastic scattering S36(n,n) in JEFF-3.2 evaluation file


2 Secondary distribution errors
2.1. Monotonically increasing energy grid
2.2. Monotonically increasing cosine grid
2.3. Secondary energy <= to incident energy There are certainly some exceptions to this,
but as a general rule, this should stand.
Comment : Reaction with positive Q-value should be an exception.
2.4. No negative angular probability values.
Comment : Right, it’s easy to check this point if angular description uses a 2-D
( mu; p( mu)). In the case of Legendre polynomials, this needs a reconstruction.
2.5. No abnormally small angular probability values


2.1 Multiplicity errors
2.1.1. Monotonically increasing energy grid
2.1.2. No negative multiplicity values
2.1.3. No abnormally large or small multiplicity values
Comment : Integer multiplicities should be checked for specific reactions. Ex : (n,2n),
nu= 2, not 1:999999 for neutrons.


2.2 Fission nu Errors
Fission nu errors are just a special case of multiplicity errors
2.2.1. Monotonically increasing energy grid
2.2.2. No negative nu values
2.2.3. Delayed neutron fraction must sum to 1.0

2.3 Additional comments
– Available Energy (AE) in a reaction depends on incident energy and Reaction QValue.
AE should be used to check energy balance. It is possible to verify that the
sum of energies of outgoing particles is lower or equal to AE. The sum could be
lower than AE if all particles are not described.
– For each energy distribution, it is possible to check that the higher energy limit and
the average energy are lower than AE. This could be applied for massive particles
and gamma
– Description of gamma cascade for discrete inelastic scatterings. It’s a crucial point
for analog calculations. ENDF-6 offers two major opportunities to describe the decay
of an excited state (in the case of inelastic scattering but also for discrete transfer
reactions) :
– The first one (best one) is the use of MF12. In this case, for each excited state,
you find the decay probability to lower states, without cascade. Only one gamma
emission is suggested. So, it’s possible to reconstruct the gamma cascade with
right probabilities.
– The second one (“bad” one) is the use of double differential energy-angle distributions
(MF6). In this case, you find a gamma multiplicity (which could differ to
one) and a composite discrete-continuous energy spectra.
– A important number of evaluation files contain gamma multiplicity lower than
one. This could be possible in the case of outgoing metastable state or competitive
decay mode. But, a careful study shows that it is not always the case.
– This description implies the loose of correlation between consecutive gamma
emission from excited states. Example : Al27 from ENDF/B-VIII.b4, second
excited state (MT52). Description used : MF6. Excited energy : 1.014 MeV.
Gamma decay modes :
– 3% to 1st state at 843 keV (emission of a 170keV gamma), then decay to GS
(843keV gamma). 100% Correlation between those two gamma.
– 97% to GS , 1.014 MeV
In evaluation file, 170keV and 843keV have the same probability : 2:8% and
1.014MeV has a 94:4% probability. Total multiplicity is 1.029. The average
energy balance is well described, but, using multiplicity and probabilities it
is tricky to reconstruct the correlation. This case is quite easy, for an higher
excited state, it becomes impossible.
– JEFF-Libraries and ENDF/B-Libraries very often use Lin-Lin interpolation between
incident projectile energies for angular, energy, angle-energy distribution. The use of
Unit-Base Lin-Lin should be preferable. JENDL Libraries apply this modification.
Patholigical cases : If you use a dirac description (closed to discontinuities) for
gamma decay in a continuous spectrum, the use of Unite Base Lin-Lin implies the
loose of this discrete gamma rays.
– Some evaluation files use double differential angle-energy (MF6) description for outgoing
neutron in the case of inelastic scattering and MF12/MF14 for gamma production.
This is mot the optimized way to describe the kinematics.
These comments are linked to ENDF-6 format files, but, it would be an improvement to
take them into account in GNDS

3 Resonance Errors
3.1 Resolved Resonance Region
The ~ J =~l + ~s should be verified. J value is given in ENDF-6 format, sometimes, it’s
impossible to obtain this value using l and s. It could be applied in URR. Ex : U241 and
Pu243 in ENDF/B-VIII.b4 library
– auto-correlation for level spacing could be checked
– Gamma distributions could be studied
– SLBW and MLBW : partial reactions sum to total
3.2 Unresolved Resonance Region
– Partial reactions sum to total
– No negatives probability table values
In the case of LSSF=1, comparisons between Tabulated cross sections in evaluation and
calculated average cross sections could be made.
